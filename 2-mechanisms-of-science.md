**Biagioli, M. (2013). Rights or Rewards? Changing Frameworks of Scientific Authorship.** In M. Biagioli & P. Gallison. _Scientific Authorship: Credit and Intellectual Property in Science_ (1st ed., pp. 253-279). Routledge.

This chapter deals with the problems derived from using authorship as an attribution of credit in times of _Big Science_ characterized by multiauthorship and team science. The author presents two alternative definitions for scientific authorship. Scientific authorship is considered a symbolic reward not attached to the specific object (the article) but to the true claims made in such object, and it is given by peers. This means that "a scientific claim does not count as such unless it is made public and subjected to peer evaluation" (p. 254).
Multiauthorship includes a layer of complexity to the evaluation of scientific performance, as it introduces ambiguity: evaluators have to assess the value of the paper and the share of such value attributed to the candidate. "[T]he economy of science is inherently based on trust" (p. 260). The author argues that copyright does not hold for our understanding of scientific author and hence proposes a redefinition. It indicates two positions, one which tries to reinforce the figure of the author in the traditional sense, a second one which divides. Biagioli maintains that the solution is not either this or to partition credit among authors as cutting slices of a pie.
Regarding the two alternative definitions. The first one is that of _contributorship_, which comes from the biomedical sciences. In the original proposal order of contributors would reflect importance. One of those contributors would play the rol of the _guarantor_, that is, the person(s) who are responsible for overseeing the whole study and coordinating. The second definition comes from high energy physics, it considers the creation of a Standard Author List for all people who have contributed in any way to a given project, regardless of their involvement on specific papers, and they appear alphabetically. To be part of this list, researchers have to compromise a share of their time and work, and this list is updated biannually by a committee. (p. 270)
