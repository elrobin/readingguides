**Biagioli, M. (2013). Rights or Rewards? Changing Frameworks of Scientific Authorship.** In M. Biagioli & P. Gallison. _Scientific Authorship: Credit and Intellectual Property in Science_ (1st ed., pp. 253-279). Routledge.
This chapter deals with the problems derived from using authorship as an attribution of credit in times of _Big Science_ characterized by multiauthorship and team science. The author presents two alternative decisions for scientific authorship. Scientific authorship is considered a symbolic reward not attached to the specific object (the article) but to the true claims made in such object, and it is given by peers. This means that "a scientific claim does not count as such unless it is made public and subjected to peer evaluation" (p. 254).

Multiauthorship includes a layer of complexity to the evaluation of scientific performance, as it introduces ambiguity: evaluators have to assess the value of the paper and the share of such value attributed to the candidate. "[T]he economy of science is inherently based on trust" (p. 260).
