## Cultural aspects

## Social structure and trust
**Lamont, M. (2009). _How Professors Think_. Harvard University Press.**
This book delves into how academic judgment is formed, examining trust, credibility, and social dynamics in the evaluation process among professors, making it relevant to the social structures that foster trust within academic communities. The author discusses issues such as homophily in judgment, fairness, epistemological diversity, methodological pluralism or cognitive contextualization. Through interviews, the author tries to better comprehend the process of judgment and the reasoning behind peer review and evaluation.

In the first chapter, Lamont contextualizes her work, her point of departure, and situates the study of peer review she undertakes in the literature. She exposes the position of Richard Whitley and Bourdieu and criticizes the lack of definition concepts such as _excellence_ or _promising_ have. She contends that peer review and evaluation do not simply follow a competitive or market logic, but also emotions and self-image play an important role in the process.

## Peer review and gatekeeping

**Lee, C. J., Sugimoto, C. R., Zhang, G., & Cronin, B. (2013). Bias in peer review. _Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 64_(1), 2–17.**
This paper reviews biases in peer review. They start by describing the different types of peer review and their role in encouraging impartiality and some practices such as disclosing conflicts of interest (or avoiding them). It discusses the broad use of peer review in academia: journals, conference evaluations, editorial peer review, promotion and tenure decisions, or funding of grant proposals among others. Peer review is the internal control academia exerts to self-regulate its activity. They define biases as those that endanger “impartiality” in the peer review process. The study reviews notions of impartiality and biases on peer review. They start with a brief history of peer review.

  > The focal point of bias has not been defined unambiguously in the literature” p. 4 -> Refers to Bornmann 2008.

They define bias as the violation of impartiality. They acknowledge that the notion of impartiality in peer review is contested in the literature. They identify works on biases:

1. as deviations from _true quality_. Divided into three subcategories:
   +  as deviations from proxy measures of true quality,
   + as low inter-rater reliability.
2. as functions of author characteristics, that is, social biases:
   + prestige bias
   + affiliation bias
   + nationality bias
   + language bias
   + gender bias
3. as a function of reviewers’ characteristics. Here they basically touch upon the level of rigorousness of reviewers or editors.
4. content-based bias. Here they refer to the following
   + cognitive biases
   + confirmation biases
   + conservatism
   + biases against interdisciplinary research. This could also be considered as a cognitive bias
   + publication bias. This refers to publishing positive results and not negative findings.

They then discuss studies focusing on specific types of peer review. They mainly focus on the evaluation of research outputs.

## Transparency and reproducibility

## Ethics and integrity

**Chomsky, N. (2008). The Responsibility of Intellectuals. In A. Arnove (Ed.), _The Essential Chomsky_ (pp. 39-62). Bodley Head.**

This essay discusses the moral responsibilities of intellectuals, focusing on ethical obligations, integrity, and the role of scholars in challenging misinformation and power. It aligns closely with topics around ethical frameworks and the role of integrity in scientific and intellectual work.
