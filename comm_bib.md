>The first thing to make clear is that scientists, freely making their own choice of problems and pursuing them in the light of their own personal judgment are in fact cooperating as members of a closely knit organisation.

Research is a coordinated endeavour where the results are affected depending on their internal organization. **Personal note:** Research evaluation systems based on citation impact acknowledge such coordination as a longitudinal adjustment of efforts (based on previous work and only related through citations with the rest).

Polanyi talks about the *principle of spontaneous coordination*. This may work when considering the whole community of researchers, but not when focusing on teamwork or analyzing how research works from the researcher's perspective.

>The psychologist K. Lewin has observed that one’s person never becomes fully involved either in a problem that is much too hard, nor in one that is much too easy.

By finding a definition on what is 'too difficult' or 'too easy' we could talk about incentives (Gläser's three careers) as well as skills (Consoli's approach to green jobs).

According to Polanyi, three criteria on which scientific merit is based:

1. Plausability. Is it true or false?
2. Scientific value. Is it rigourous? Has it been conducted in a systematic way?
3. Originality. Is it an actual discovery? Is it novel?

Criteria 1 and 2 relate to conformity while criterion 2 relates to dissent. Hence an internal tension on researchers' work.

The other principle of researchers' organization and functioning is that of *overlapping competences*. PAGE 7
