# Reading Guides
Here I include a list of readings on different subjects related to Social dynamics of science. ^Beware, I am currently reorganizing all of this for greater clarity^.

New reading lists:

2. [Mechanisms of science](2-mechanisms-of-science.md)
3. [Credibility and trust](3-Credibility-and-trust.md)

Old guides

- [Reading Guide on Sociology of Science](Soc_sci.md)
- [Reading Guide on Reseach Methods](Res_methods)
